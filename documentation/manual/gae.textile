h1. Google App Engine support

The GAE module enable Google App Engine support for your application. It wraps commons GAE services in play basic services when possible (Logging, Mail, Cache, ...) and expose directly other Google specifics services (User services, Datastore, ...).

Moreover, this module set up a GAE development environment directly in the play development server, so you don't need to develop directly in the Google App Engine SDK (but it's supported too ...).

h2. <a>What is supported ?</a>

* The application layout is totally standard.
* Auto reload works as expected.
* Logging is correctly dispatched to java.util.logging when the module is enabled.
* tmp folder is disabled because you can't write to the filesystem in GAE.
* Direct datastore access is fully supported.
* JPA support can be enabled but you still depends on GAE JPA limitations.
* Cache is correctly wrapped to the GAE memcached instance.
* Mail is correctly wrapped to the GAE mail service.
* Users services is available with a 'sign in' page simulation in the development server.
* You can still explode your application into several modules.
* PROD mode is forced when the application is running on the GAE production environment.

h2. <a>Setting up the GAE module</a>

Start to create a new application in the classical way.

bc. # play new test-gae

Then edit the **conf/application.conf** file to enable the GAE module :

bc. # Additional modules
# ~~~~~
# A module is another play! application. Add a line for each module you want
# to add to your application. Modules path are either absolutes or relative to
# the application root.
#
module.gae=${play.path}/modules/gae

Now you can start your application and play should start a GAE developement environment :

bc. # play run test-gae

Content of the **war** directory will be merged during the war export command. It's not something specific to the GAE module.

h2. <a>About JPA</a>

Play offers a cool abstraction of JPA through the JPASupport/Model classes. But when you use these classes on GAE a lot of problems occur. This is because the JPA support in GAE is very very different of Hibernate + a relational database.

There are two reasons you would like use JPA on Google App Engine :

* To be able to transparently move your application in/out of GAE
* Because you already know the JPA API very well, and you want reuse this knowledge.

But these 2 reasons fail. The JPA support is so different in GAE that you just can't use it in on transparent way. It will just work for a single simple entity without relations. But even with a simple relation, you will have to rely on special google classes. And because the JPA support is very different
you can't generally do things the same way you are used.

That's why our advice is to not use JPA on Google App Engine. And even if you want to use JPA you should avoid using the JPASupport/Model helpers and just rely on simple JPA examples that Google provide.

We provide an alternative persistence manager module called "Siena":siena. It is a better match for your application and your application code should be even simpler than if you used JPA.

h2. <a>Sample application</a>

You can take a look at the **samples-and-tests/lists-with-gae** as a sample of a real Google App Engine application.

p(note). **This app is available online** at "http://play-lists.appspot.com":http://play-lists.appspot.com.
