h1. YAML

h2. <a>YAML syntax</a>

When writing tests for your application it is often necessary to create data structures using many related model objects, which can be tedious to do in code. Play includes a "YAML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML parser which makes the task much simpler.

Create a YAML file like the following, in the **conf** directory

bc.. City(capitalfederal):
    name: Capital Federal
    state: Buenos Aires

User(john):
    name: "John Smith"
    email: john@john.com
    lang: es
    created: 2007-01-01

User(frank):
    name: "Frank Franken"
    email: frank@frank.com
    lang: en
    created: 2007-08-05

Neighborhood(villalugano):
    name: Villa Lugano
    city: capitalfederal
    tags: "shopping, cafes"
    users: [john, frank]

Neighborhood(coghlan):
    name: Coghlan
    city: capitalfederal
    tags: "cafes, bars"
    users: [john]

p. Play's YAML syntax varies slightly from the standard. Each stanza must start with the name of the model class (eg __Neighborhood__) and can optionally be followed by an identifier in brackets (eg __villalugano__) so that you can reference the object elsewhere in the file. This is in contrast to standard YAML syntax which uses the ampersand character to indicate a reference.

Play uses "SnakeYAML":http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/, which has an excellent "documentation page":http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/wiki/Documentation#YAML_syntax with many examples.

h2. <a>model classes</a>

The YAML file can contain one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relationships. These relationships must be explicity annotated in the model classes, and you must indicate which is the "owning side" of the relationship.

p. __City.java__

bc.. package models;

import java.util.List;
import javax.persistence.*;
import play.db.jpa.Model;

@Entity
public class City extends Model {
    public String name;
    public String state;
    
    // bi-directional one-to-many, inverse side
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "city", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    public List<Neighborhood> neighborhoods;
}

p. __Neighborhood.java__

bc.. package models;

import java.util.List;
import javax.persistence.*;
import play.db.jpa.Model;

@Entity
public class Neighborhood extends Model {
    public String name;
    
    // bi-directional one-to-many, owning side
    @ManyToOne
    public City city;
    
    public String tags;
    
    // owning side
    @ManyToMany
    public List<User> users;
}

p. __User.java__

bc.. package models;

import java.util.*;
import javax.persistence.*;
import play.db.jpa.Model;

@Entity
//@Table(name = "`user`")
public class User extends Model {
    public String name;
    public String email;
    public String lang;
    public Date created;
    
    // inverse side of the relation
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "users")
    public List<Neighborhood> neighborhoods;
}


p(note). Note that if you are using PostgreSQL you may need to explicitly set the name of the "user" table with escape characters because __user__ is a reserved word.

h2. <a>Loading the data structure in your application</a>

Typically you will load the data structure defined in the YAML file as part of a "unit test":test#aFixturesa. But sometimes you may wish to populate the database with specific data in other circumstances, for example "when your application starts":jobs#aBootstrapjoba for the first time.

bc.. import play.*;
import play.jobs.*;
import play.test.*;
import models.*;

@OnApplicationStart
public class Bootstrap extends Job {
    public void doJob() {
        // Check if the database is empty
        if(User.count() == 0) {
            Fixtures.load("initial-data.yml");
        }
    }
}

p. The objects will be created in the database, and you can then access them as you would any other model object.

bc. City city = City.all().first();
List<Neighborhood> neighborhoods = city.neighborhoods;
