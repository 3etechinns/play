h1. Deployment options

Play! applications can be deployed virtually anywhere: inside servlet container, as standalone server, Google Application Engine, Stack, a Cloud, etc...

The most popular deployment options are:

# "Standalone Play application":deployment#aStandalonePlayapplicationa
# "Application servers":deployment#aApplicationserversa
# "Google Application Engine":deployment#aGoogleApplicationEngineGAEa
# "Stax cloud hosting platform":deployment#aStaxcloudhostingplatforma

h2. <a>Standalone Play! application</a>

A Play! application can be run using the standard embedded server: Mina, a high performance and high scalability network server.
Different "modules":http://playframework.org/modules allows you to use a different server (Grizzly, Netty, etc...) as well.
Please refer to the "'Put your application in production' page":production for more information.

h2. <a>Application servers</a>

Your Play! application can also run inside your favorite application server. Most of the application servers are supported out of the box.
Refer to the "application servers section":applicationserver for more information.

h2. <a>Google Application Engine (GAE)</a>

A Play! application can very easily be deployed to the GAE. It is a matter of installing the relevant "GAE module.":http://playframework.org/modules/gae

bc. play install gae

Deploying to the Google Application Engine is again really easy:

bc. play gae:deploy myapp

Refer to the "module documentation":http://playframework.org/modules/gae-1.0.2/home for more information.

h2. <a>Stax cloud hosting platform</a>

Easy deployment to Stax cloud hosting platform (http://www.stax.net): again nothing easier. Install the stax module and deploy within seconds.

Refer to the "module documentation":http://www.playframework.org/modules/stax-1.0.1/home for more information.
